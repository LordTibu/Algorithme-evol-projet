## Prerequisites :
   ```
  Unity

## Description 

This project is intended to be the final rendering of the LIFPROJET UE, where we have chosen the topic
physical animation and morphology optimization of animated creatures.
In this context, we have chosen to apply evolutionary algorithms to a problem
of generating creatures that seek to move as long as possible in relation to their
its appearance. To design this project, we decided to divide the subject into
into 4 main tasks:
```
- Simple creature generation
- Creature complexity
- Crossbreeding creatures
- Mutation
```
